# MOD2 HOOD OVERLOOK HOTEL
This application was built as the final project for Module 2 of the [Turing School of Software Design](https://turing.edu/) frontend program.
It allows users (from an API) to log into their account at the Hood Overlook Hotel and review their past bookings and the amount they've spent on those bookings. A customer can also use a calendar to book a room and see their updated bookings and amount spent.
